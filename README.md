# KNIT-Result-Analyser<br />
This is python code to analyse Knit Result.<br />
To Run this code you need to install Selenium and Tkinter<br />
Here FinalGui.py is the main file and should be used to run the program.<br />
fetch.py is used to fetch the result of complete batch and it takes time to print the final result.<br />
singleres.py is used to fetch the result of one student and it is shown in web browser.<br />
Also chrome browser should be installed on your pc to run this project.<br />
Chrome driver should be placed at this this location 'C:\\chromedriver.exe' to ensure the smooth running of program<br />
